Brief
Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Search for GitHub users by their username
See relevant user information based on their search
Switch between light and dark themes
Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.

Getting started
Download the starter code

Set up the project with version control (e.g. Git)

Read the README.md file and have a look around the project

Download the design files, we provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design

Get colors, fonts, etc from the design system in the design file

Set up your project/file architecture however you want

Start coding!

Ideas to test yourself
Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus

Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can

Use a JavaScript framework/library to practice templating and/or building using components

Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked, but is important for professional developers
