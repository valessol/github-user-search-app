The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6) is to build out a GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Through this app, users are be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

Sincerely, I think that is really difficult to search an user if I don't know their usernames previously. So, I put them in a select list and you can now choose the user you want to search.
